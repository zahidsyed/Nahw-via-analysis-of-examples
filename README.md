# Learning nahw analytically

The purpose of these notes is two-fold:
1. To provide a more intuitive, rapid method for reviewing Arabic syntax rules i.e. نحو, if you have already studied them and
2. A more engaging, student-centric method for teaching it. They can also be used for self-learning but this is not the objective I had in mind when designing these notes.

## The elevator pitch

### A demonstrative example
To appreciate the benefit of these notes, below are two versions describing the same نحو concepts. Read each for the same amount of time and try comprehending it - viewing them from the perspective of a reviewer, or a student learning under a teacher.

#### First, a نحو concept from a reference book.

#### Second, the same concept from the notes
For this version
1. Read in this order: **Headings** → **Observe** column → **Compare** column.
2. Ignore the Grey text until you figure out the rule yourself. <br> <br>

### Who are these notes for
Based on the design objective, these notes cater to three types of students:

| Type                                                                                                        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. The **reviewer** who has already studied grammar books written in Arabic and is familiar with the نحو rules.                                                   | This student can use these notes for rapidly reviewing نحو rules after studying and understanding from the grammar books written in Arabic. They save much time in this regard. This is the prime reason why I made them. <br> <br> **A word of advice** The serious student of knowledge should NOT use this while abandoning grammar books written in Arabic. See below* for one of my teachers' comment on why doing so is detrimental in the long-term. |
| 2. The **middling student with a teacher**                                                             | This student can use these notes to grasp the basics of نحو under a teacher, and as a stepping stone for ultimately studying Arabic grammar books. <br> <br> The teaching method is explained later below. I hope this makes for a more fun, student-centric way to teach نحو than other methods.                                                                                                          |
| 3. The **middling self-learner** with basic grammar skills but has not yet studied the نحو rules.*  | This student can use these notes to learn most of نحو without reading an Arabic grammar book IF they have basic Arabic grammar skills (mentioned later). As mentioned before, this is not the prime reason I have designed these notes. <br> <br> Just as with the reviewer, I advise this student not to abandon learning to read grammar books written in Arabic.                                                                             |

_* The (long-term) objective (for the serious student) isn't just to learn grammar, but to learn how to read grammar books because when you read the Islamic sciences as a whole, you will find grammar discussions in tafsir, hadith, fiqh (often interpreting Qur'an and hadith), and commentaries of books. Those discussions are often at a higher level than the (basic grammar) books, so students will likely need to pick up more advanced nahw books like commentaries of Alfiyya and the like, either to review the grammar or look up more advanced discussions. So if students struggle to read classical grammar texts, they will be stuck. - Ust Abdul Hakim Vazquez_


For the **reviewer**, the core concepts have been laid out with just enough hints to analyze and recall the rules. I have found this to be faster than when reviewing from a book that uses a wall of text method.

For the middling student (with or without a teacher), the notes provide a mechanism to apply their prior knowledge of Arabic grammar to infer new rules. Thus, the mental effort such a student exerts when reading these notes is on very different tasks compared to traditional grammar books.

The key difference is that, in these notes, the burden of rule analysis is placed on the student instead of spoon-feeding the definition and the explanation as it happens in typical grammar books. This results in a deeper understanding of the rule if both approaches are given the same amount of time.

There is much that the above explanation cannot convey that hopefully the prior example does. 

## What these notes can (and cannot) help you achieve

# What are the prerequisites to using these notes?
## For the reviewer
All that is required is that you understand how to 'read' the tables. Please go through the related sections in [the Wiki](https://github.com/zahidsyed/learning-nahw-analytically/tree/main/pdf) and you are set.

## For the middling student
The more you know of the following, the easier the time you will have:
1. You know your sarf tables or can at least recognize sing, dual and plurals in most forms.
2. You know إعراب and its various types: فتحة، ضمة، كسرة، ، الألف، الياء، الواو etc.
3. You know basic roles in a sentence: فعل، فاعل، مفعول، مبتدأ، خبر
4. You are able to parse basic Arabic sentences into their constituent parts. مبتدأ، خبر، فاعل، مفعول معمول، حال etc. These are only mentioned where a rule cannot be deduced otherwise.
5. You have a solid beginner vocabulary. Difficult sentences are translated.
