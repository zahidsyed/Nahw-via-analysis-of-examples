# Learning nahw analytically
This is an excerpt from the **Introduction** page. Please visit the **pdf** or **onenote** folder for the complete document.

## The elevator pitch

Say you are reviewing نحو rules or are teaching it, or perhaps even learning it, be you a native Arabic speaker or non-native. Below are two versions describing the same نحو concepts. Read each for the same amount of time.

### Version 1

### Version 2
For this next version, focus simply on the heading and the **Observe** column.

Regardless of your Arabic proficiency, which version:
- Is easier to review with?
- Leads to a deeper understanding in the same amount of time?
- Conveys the concept behind the rules quicker?
- Conveys the rule hierarchy?
- Allows easier comparison of rules?
- Is easier to teach with?
	
## What these notes can (and cannot) help you achieve

These are based on my experiences as a non-native early-intermediate level student of Arabic and as a teacher, not on empirical proof.

### Students
| Expected outcomes                                           | Commentary                                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| + Recalling concepts and examples far quicker               | than when using a reference book. This is the primary purpose of these notes.          |
| + A deeper understanding of نحو rules                       | compared to a reference book, given identical time investment                          |
| - Cover all minutiae of نحو                                 | I am not that qualified. Out of scope. The objective is to convey the core concepts.   |
| - Providing numerous examples for each case                 | Out of scope                                                                           |
| + Learning the rules conceptually                           |                                                                                        |
| - Learning precise definitions                              | Use reference books for this                                                           |
| + Expose gaps in your knowledge so you can fill them in     | because you cannot deduce the rule from examples till you know the underlying concepts |
| + Make it easier to understand a classical sharh afterwards |                                                                                        |
| +/- Proficiency in recognizing their usage in other texts   | when practiced with other texts and examples                                           |
| - Writing or speaking proficiently                          | as it requires more than just knowing نحو rules                                        |

### Teachers (untested, expected outcomes)
- Teach Arabic grammar in a more engaging manner
- Less time spent structuring content ⇒ more time on delivering content
- Student-centric ⇒ Less lecturing ⇒ Less draining ⇒ More time for research *wink*

# What are the prerequisites to using these notes?
## For self learners
**Note** The primary purpose of these notes is for reviewing what you have already learnt or to be taught by someone. However, if you meet the below prerequisites, then you can likely self learn the nahw rules:
1. You know your sarf tables or can at least recognize sing, dual and plurals in most forms.
2. You know إعراب and its various types: فتحة، ضمة، كسرة، ، الألف، الياء، الواو etc.
3. You know basic roles in a sentence: فعل، فاعل، مفعول، مبتدأ، خبر
4. You are able to parse basic Arabic sentences into their constituent parts. مبتدأ، خبر، فاعل، مفعول معمول، حال etc. These are only mentioned where a rule cannot be deduced otherwise.
5. You can read with only the necessary diacritical marks present. Sometimes, full tashkeel is not present in non-critical text. This will be fixed, إن شاء الله
6. You have a solid beginner vocabulary. Difficult sentences are translated.

## For teachers (untested, expected)
1. The fewer the above pre-requisites that students have met, the greater the teacher's focus and time spent on background content than on grammar-related deductions and explanations. 
2. Either way, students will be compelled to fill gaps in understanding as they learn new material.

# Why make these notes?
It came about while reviewing my Arabic grammar notes in the summer of 2022. Doing so rapidly was proving near impossible. I had already tried multiple ways of note-taking for نحو over the past decade, but none were to my satisfaction.

Furthermore, while studying Baghdadi's نيل المنى and Ibn Hisham's شرح قطر الندى, I realized they are wonderful reference books, but inefficient for internalizing the نحو rules and, more importantly, when reviewing them. 

Remember the elevator pitch I mentioned above? The issues from a learner and reviewer's perspective are:
1. **Issue 1** A 'definitions and rules primary, and examples secondary' approach. This spoon-feeds rules and lifts much of the burden of rule analysis and comprehension from the reader. This is great for reference, but inefficient when learning.
2. **Issue 2** The 'know how to read Arabic to learn نحو' problem which is a somewhat chicken-and-egg problem.
3. **Issue 3** A 'wall of text' approach devoid of appropriate sectioning and layout that is time-consuming to parse rules, to compare and contrast related rules, and to visualize their hierarchy.
4. **Issue 4** It is also time consuming to review using these books due to the wall of text. My notes from them were just another wall of text with slightly more structure.

From a teaching perspective:
1. **Issue 5** Teaching Arabic becomes lecture-centric (i.e. talking head format) which goes back to Issue 1 (listening and understanding), instead of a more engaging system (student-centric analyzing and inferring).

So I worked my way backwards from what issues I saw fit to address. As I created the notes, I realized that they were worth sharing with others, and also extremely good for teaching, so I added many features such that it's accessible to the largest possible group. بِفَضْلِ اللهِ I managed to create and polish the system and also apply it to a third of نيل المنى in August 2022.
