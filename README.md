# Learning nahw analytically

_It is easy to create a dry, boring, but accurate resource for a complex topic. The challenge is to create something that is effective yet fun to learn from and to teach with._

I have developed this system targeting three use cases, two primary and one secondary.

**Primary use cases**
1. Reviewing: If you have already studied نحو (Arabic syntax), this is a more intuitive, rapid system for reviewing it.
2. Learning under a teacher: This system offer a more engaging, student-centric, evidence-based system for teaching نحو before serious students step into deeper books. This part is still under development.

**Secondary use case**

3. Self-learning: While this is possible, this system is, at its core, developed for reviewing and teaching - there are no detailed explanations for difficult concepts.

**Note:** The current version targets only an English-speaking audience for whom Arabic is a 2nd language.
