# Learning nahw analytically

_It is easy to create a bone dry, boring, but superbly accurate learning resource for a complex topic. The real challenge is to make it effective, yet fun to learn from and to teach with._

I have developed this system targeting three use cases, two primary and one secondary.

**Primary use cases**
1. Reviewing: If you have already studied نحو (Arabic syntax), this is a more intuitive, rapid system for reviewing it.
2. Learning under a teacher: It provides the core resources needed to teach نحو using active learning strategies, the goal being to facilitate an engaging, student-centric, collaborative learning environment grounded in evidence based teaching techniques. This part is still under development.

**Secondary use case**

3. Self-learning: While this is possible, this system is, at its core, developed for reviewing and teaching - there are no detailed explanations for difficult concepts to help self-learners.

**Note:** The current version targets only an English-speaking audience for whom Arabic is a 2nd language. This work is still under development. See the [Table of Contents](https://github.com/zahidsyed/learning-nahw-analytically/blob/main/pdf/0%20-%20Table%20of%20contents%2C%20chapters%20completed%20till%20date.pdf) for completed chapters.
