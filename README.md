## The elevator pitch

The purpose of these notes is to provide a more intuitive method for reviewing, teaching and learning Arabic syntax, i.e. نحو. These notes can serve three types of students in different ways:

| Who                                                                                                        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. The reviewer who is studying grammar books in Arabic and is familiar with the نحو rules.                                                   | This student can use these notes for rapidly reviewing نحو rules after studying and understanding from the Arabic grammar books. They save much time in this regard. <br> <br> However, I advise this student NOT to use these notes for learning نحو, but only for reviewing them. See below* for one of my teachers' comment on why this is so. |
| 2. The middling student with basic reading skills but has not yet studied the rules.                                                             | This student can use these notes if they have basic Arabic grammar skills (mentioned later). Please see the warning above. I advise you to learn to read Arabic grammar books even if you have understood the rules from here.                                                                                                          |
| 3. The beginner being taught by a teacher. This student is currently unable to read Arabic grammar books.  | This student can use these notes to grasp the basics of نحو under a teacher, and as a stepping stone for ultimately studying Arabic grammar books.<br> <br> These notes provide (I hope) a more fun and intuitive way to teach نحو for beginners than other methods.                                                                             |

_* The objective (for the serious student) isn't just to learn grammar, but to learn how to read grammar books because when you read the Islamic sciences as a whole, you will find grammar discussions in tafsir, hadith, fiqh (often interpreting Qur'an and hadith), and commentaries of books. Those discussions are often at a higher level than the (basic grammar) books, so students will likely need to pick up more advanced nahw books like commentaries of Alfiyya and the like, either to review the grammar or look up more advanced discussions. So if students struggle to read classical grammar texts, they will be stuck. - Ust Abdul Hakim Vazquez_

### A demonstrative example
To appreciate the benefit of these notes, below are two versions describing the same نحو concepts. Read each for the same amount of time and try comprehending it - viewing them from the perspective of either of the three types of students mentioned above.

#### First, a نحو concept from a reference book.

#### Second, the same concept from the notes
For this version, read in this order: **Headings** → **Observe** column. Ignore the Grey text until you figure out the rule yourself. <br> <br>

### Discussion
For the reviewer, the core concepts have been laid out with just enough hints to analyze and recall the rules. I have found this to be faster than when reviewing from a book that uses a wall of text method.

For the middling student and the beginner, the notes provide a mechanism to apply their prior knowledge of Arabic grammar to infer new rules. Thus, the mental effort such a student exerts during this exercise is on very different tasks compared to grammar books. The typical thought process when comprehending using these two methods varies as shown below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5341129/193292533-4ca2c69a-3d00-4793-935c-8374c0a59b0b.png)


The key difference is that, in these notes, the burden of rule analysis is placed on the student instead of spoon-feeding the definition and the explanation as it happens in typical grammar books. This results in a deeper understanding of the rule if both approaches are given the same amount of time.

There is much that the above explanation cannot convey that hopefully the prior example does. 

## What these notes can (and cannot) help you achieve
### For all students

### For the reviewer

### For the beginner

### For the teacher
I haven't tested these but based on my experience as a teacher, I expect these outcomes:

# What are the prerequisites to using these notes?
## For reviewers
All that is required is that you understand how to 'read' the tables. Please go through the sections later below on this and you are set.

## For middling students
Along with the above:
1. You know your sarf tables or can at least recognize sing, dual and plurals in most forms.
2. You know إعراب and its various types: فتحة، ضمة، كسرة، ، الألف، الياء، الواو etc.
3. You know basic roles in a sentence: فعل، فاعل، مفعول، مبتدأ، خبر
4. You are able to parse basic Arabic sentences into their constituent parts. مبتدأ، خبر، فاعل، مفعول معمول، حال etc. These are only mentioned where a rule cannot be deduced otherwise.
5. You have a solid beginner vocabulary. Difficult sentences are translated.

## For teachers (untested, expected)
The fewer the above pre-requisites that beginner students have met, the greater the teacher's focus and time spent on background content than on grammar-related deductions and explanations. Either way, students will be compelled to fill gaps in understanding as they learn new material.
