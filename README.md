# Learning nahw analytically

To download the PDF notes, see the latest release on the [project homepage.](https://github.com/zahidsyed/learning-nahw-analytically). It will be in the right-side bar (on desktop) or at the bottom (on mobile).

This is an excerpt from the **Wiki**. The full document can be found in the release package.

## The elevator pitch

The purpose of these notes is to provide a more intuitive method for reviewing, teaching and learning Arabic syntax, i.e. نحو. To appreciate its advantages over using only grammar reference books, observe the examples below for the following use cases:

| Use case #                                                           | Comments                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Using the notes alone as opposed to only reading a reference book | for reviewing or teaching. Self-learning is also possible as mentioned later below.  |
| 2. Using the notes as an entry point for reading a reference book.   | Parsing a reference book is easier afterwards for reasons which are mentioned later. |

### Use case 1 - Using the notes in isolation
Below are two versions describing the same نحو concepts. Read each for the same amount of time and compare their ease of use.

#### First, a نحو concept from a reference book.

#### Second, the same concept from the notes
For this version, read in this order: **Headings** → **Observe** column. Ignore the Grey text until you figure out the rule yourself. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5341129/191884627-1f600a79-4b93-480f-b93d-09d8d3030e10.png)

If you are a reviewer, the core concepts have been laid out with just enough hints for you to analyze and recall the rules yourself. If you are a teacher/student, it is on the student to take time to infer as much of the rules as possible without glancing at the grey text.

If you need further convincing, we will be reading the next example in the opposite order. 

### Use case 2 - The notes as an entry point for reference books
#### Read the notes first to grasp the core concepts…

#### and then read the reference text for further understanding

### Conclusion
The entirety of the text in the notes could easily be turned to Arabic for further immersion. Regardless, with or without that, I propose that the notes:
1. Are easier to review with.
2. Lead to a deeper understanding in the same amount of time.
3. Convey the concept behind the rules quicker.
4. Convey the rule hierarchy.
5. Allow easier comparison of rules.
6. Are easier to teach with.

## What these notes can (and cannot) help you achieve

These are based on my experiences as a non-native early-intermediate level student of Arabic and as a teacher, not on empirical proof.

### Students
| Expected outcomes                                           | Commentary                                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| + Recalling concepts and examples far quicker               | than when using a reference book. This is the primary purpose of these notes.          |
| + A deeper understanding of نحو rules                       | compared to a reference book, given identical time investment                          |
| - Cover all minutiae of نحو                                 | I am not that qualified. Out of scope. The objective is to convey the core concepts.   |
| +/- Providing numerous examples for each case                 | I have collated examples from ibn Hisham's شرح قطر الندى and from نيل المنى. Some topics have more than others.                                                                            |
| + Learning the rules conceptually                           |  since you are expected to analyze the sentences and infer the rules.                |
| - Learning precise definitions                              | Use reference books for this                                                           |
| + Expose gaps in your knowledge so you can fill them in     | because you cannot deduce the rule from examples till you know the underlying concepts |
| + Make it easier to understand a classical sharh afterwards |                                                                                        |
| - Replace classical references                              | Different purposes, different audiences. Use the right tool for the right job. |
| +/- Proficiency in recognizing their usage in other texts   | when practiced with other texts and examples                                           |
| - Writing or speaking proficiently                          | as it requires more than just knowing نحو rules                                        |

### Teachers (untested, expected outcomes)
- Teach Arabic grammar in a more engaging manner
- Less time spent structuring content ⇒ more time on delivering content
- Student-centric ⇒ Less lecturing ⇒ Less draining ⇒ More time for research *wink*

# What are the prerequisites to using these notes?
## For reviewers
Read the sections on how to 'read' the tables and examples, and you are set.

## For self learners
**Note** The primary purpose of these notes is for reviewing what you have already learnt or to be taught by someone. However, if you meet the below prerequisites, then you can likely self learn the nahw rules:
1. You know your sarf tables or can at least recognize sing, dual and plurals in most forms.
2. You know إعراب and its various types: فتحة، ضمة، كسرة، ، الألف، الياء، الواو etc.
3. You know basic roles in a sentence: فعل، فاعل، مفعول، مبتدأ، خبر
4. You are able to parse basic Arabic sentences into their constituent parts. مبتدأ، خبر، فاعل، مفعول معمول، حال etc. These are only mentioned where a rule cannot be deduced otherwise.
5. You have a solid beginner vocabulary. Difficult sentences are translated.

## For teachers (untested, expected)
1. The fewer the above pre-requisites that students have met, the greater the teacher's focus and time spent on background content than on grammar-related deductions and explanations. 
2. Either way, students will be compelled to fill gaps in understanding as they learn new material.

# Why make these notes?
It came about while reviewing my Arabic grammar notes in the summer of 2022. Doing so rapidly was proving near impossible. I had already tried multiple ways of note-taking for نحو over the past decade, but none were to my satisfaction.

Remember the elevator pitch I mentioned above? While studying Baghdadi's نيل المنى and Ibn Hisham's شرح قطر الندى, I realized they are wonderful reference books, but inefficient for internalizing the نحو rules and, more importantly, when reviewing them. 

These are the issues I found from a learner and reviewer's perspective and the mechanism I have used to address them in my notes:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5341129/187830400-c7559e01-532a-45c1-83ae-6fe25fe4c514.png)

As I created the notes, I realized that they were worth sharing with others, and also extremely good for teaching, so I added many features such that it's accessible to the largest possible group.  I began in Aug 2022, and بِفَضْلِ اللهِ prepared 19 of the 52 chapters that month.
