# Issues with PDFs
1. The hyperlinks in PDFs dont work (yet). If you need them, use the [Onenote file](https://github.com/zahidsyed/learning-nahw-analytically/tree/main/onenote) instead.
2. The PDFs are not (yet) print-friendly, i.e. the font may be too small to read when printed (unless you print on a larger paper).
