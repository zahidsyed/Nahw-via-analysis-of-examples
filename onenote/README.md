# Using the OneNote file

1. This is the source OneNote file. I recommended opening it with OneNote for Windows 10.
2. To open it: Download file > Unzip > Right-click > Open with... > OneNote for Windows 10
3. It will also work with OneNote 2016 but the layout may be badly rendered with tables and drawings offset from their correct position.
