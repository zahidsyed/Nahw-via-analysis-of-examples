# Using the OneNote file

1. This is the source OneNote file if you dont prefer the PDFs in the release. I recommended opening it with OneNote for Windows 10.
2. To open it: Download file > Right-click > Open with... > OneNote for Windows 10
3. It will also work with OneNote 2016 but drawings may be offset from the correct position.
