# Using the OneNote file

1. This is the recommended file format to use for reading and editing the notes.
2. It is a OneNote file. I recommended opening it with OneNote for Windows 10.
3. To open it: Download file > Right-click > Open with... > OneNote for Windows 10
4. It will also work with OneNote 2016 but drawings may be offset from the correct position.
